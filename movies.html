Harvard student Cameron reluctantly agrees to take a break from his busy student life and go to a dance organized by his English literature professor, Charles Gordon.

With some trepidation Zoe accepts the offer, but the two only stay at the dance long enough to make Cameron's old girlfriend jealous. Meanwhile, bachelor Howard, a witty, successful, career-obsessed day trader, gets pressed into M.C.-ing the dance. His date is Alyson, a sweet, kindhearted single mother of two who is really excited about her first post-divorce date. At first she shrugs off Howard's insensitive, sarcastic wit, but when it hits too close to home, she confronts him about it. As for Charles, he's the ultimate genius on romance and Shakespeare when he's teaching.</p>
